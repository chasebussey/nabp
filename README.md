# Not Another Base Planner
Not Another Base Planner is intended to be a suite of tools to assist players of the game
[Prosperous Universe](prosperousuniverse.com) plan bases, supply chains, and the like.

At this time, the project is under very early development. If you're looking for a good base
planning tool, I recommend [PRUNner](https://github.com/Jacudibu/PRUNner), a full-featured tool
that's already been battle-tested by the community.

## Simple Roadmap
- [ ] PRUNner-style base planning
- [ ] Supply chain generation: get a full tree view of all inputs for some given material
- [ ] Base generation: take a supply chain, and get a (probably not very good) base template to produce it
